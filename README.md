===========

NO FRAMEWORKS WERE ALLOWED, we HAD to use PHP 5.3 (in July-August 2014!). This was written in a period of about two weeks total, though the commits say it was about 27 days. This was a project that was supposed to take 4 months, and we had to reach a milestone every week. 

* Week 1 was Alpha. 
* Week 2 was Beta. 
* Week 3 was Release Client 
* Week 4 was Final Release

In order to meet these deadlines, we did horrible, terrible, unspeakable things. __However__, *there are some pretty cool things included in here*:

* Assets are GZIPed
* Database is designed pretty well
* Can run user scripts written in python (horrible, terrible, despicable security flaws here)
* Communication between three different applications via JSON
* Cross Origin Resource Sharing
* The UI is pretty (and functional!)
* Some of the tables implement pagination
* Backend is RESTful - mostly, but the abstraction broke down as our time ran out (deadlines!)
